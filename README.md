# Step by Step Instructions (One-time)  
**(One-time) Preparation:** 
1. Buy 1pcs high speed USB Drive 64GB or 128GB.  
   (Recommend SanDisk Extreme Pro CZ880 128GB, Read/Write=420MBps/380MBps)  
   (Recommend ~~SanDisk Extreme Go CZ800 64GB, Read/Write=200MBps/150MBps~~)  
   USB Drive speed matters, data is frequently accessed during training, please buy the best one.
2. Use Windows 10 Disk Management to merge USB Drive 2 partitions into just 1.  
   Newly purchased USB Drive used to have 2 partitions that we cannot use.  
   (7 ways to open Disk Management in Windows 10 https://goo.gl/SpLMqW )  
   (If Disk Management cannot merge USB partitions, google search 'DiskPart' to clean USB partitions.  
   DiskPart commands are: List Disk -> Select Disk # -> List Partition -> Clean)  
   Format the Single Partition USB Drive in any format that Windows can recognize.  
3. Download 'Acronis True Image 2018'. (Trial period for free, $49.99 per copy).  
   Link = https://www.acronis.com/en-us/personal/computer-backup/  
4. Download 21GB USB Drive image I prepared for you.  
   File Name = 'DLImage_v1.0-4-7_full_b1_s1_v1.tib'  
   Link = https://goo.gl/FF3dQ2  

**(One-time) Restore USB Image in 7 steps:**  
1. Install/Sign_In 'Acronis True Image 2018', then quit/close it.  
2. Move downloaded 21GB USB Drive image to windows desktop.  
3. Right click that 21GB Drive image icon on desktop, click 'Acronix True Image', then click 'Validate'.

4. Acronix True Image app will be launched, choose the image been added on the upper left. (STEP1)  
![](/photo/Picture1b.png)  
5. Choose 'Recovery' on the top. (STEP2)  
   Choose 'Recovery disk' on the bottom. (STEP3)  
![](/photo/Picture1c.png)
6. Choose the 'Backup Image' on the middle left. (STEP4)  
   Choose the 'Recover to' empty USB Disk on the middle right. (STEP5)  
   Choose the 'Recovery now' on the bottom right. (STEP6)  
![](/photo/Picture1d.png)  
   This will pop up a new window.  
   On the newly pop up page, you must **Check** the **`'Shot down the computer after completion'`** on the bottom. Important! (STEP7)  
7. Automatically shot down after Restore USB Image.  

**(One-time) Setup motherboard BIOS + test USB Drive is NVIDIA GPU acceleration supported:**  
1. When power off, plug-in the USB Drive.
2. While booting up, enter motherboard BIOS settings.  
3. On BIOS. **`Disable 'Secure Boot'`** or **`Enable 'CSM (Compatibility Support Module)'`** 
   Refer this if you don't know how to do:
   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIuEb-Ek6-U
4. On BIOS. Remain default 'UEFI boot' option without change it.  
5. On BIOS. **`'Boot Priority/Sequency' choose to boot from the USB Drive`**.  
6. On BIOS. Save changes and reboot.  
7. In Ubuntu. It will boot into Ubuntu, the Ubuntu login password = **`nvidia`**  
8. In Ubuntu. Press hot keys 'ctrl'+'alt'+'t' to open Ubuntu terminal window.  
9. In Ubuntu. Type command **`nvidia-smi`** to exam if your NVIDIA GPU model is correctly recognized and listed.  
   If your NVIDIA GPU model is shown, it means everything works fine.

10. (Optional) If your USB Drive is more than 64GB. This USB Image is created with 64GB sized USB Drive. If your USB Drive is more than 64GB physically, after restore your USB Drive will show 64GB only. You can use Ubuntu instruction 'sudo gparted' to expend size.  
     In Ubuntu, Type command **`sudo gparted`**  
     It requires Ubuntu login password, the Ubuntu login password = **`nvidia`**  
     Right click 64GB partition, select Resize it.  
     Drag bar to right end to increase 64GB partition to max physical capacity.
     Click the 'Green Check Mark' to

# Start DL Coding (Every time) 
**Every time Start DL Coding (basic):**  
1. Boot from restored Ubuntu USB Drive, the Ubuntu login password = **`nvidia`**  
2. Press hot keys 'ctrl'+'alt'+'t' to launch Ubuntu terminal window.  
3. Type command **`sudo docker start -ai tensorflowkeras`** to run the 'tensorflowkeras' docker image.  
   Ubuntu login password = **`nvidia`**  
![](/photo/Picture3a.png)  
4. It will show a link, right click mouse to open that link with Firefox.  
![](/photo/Picture3b.png)  
5. It's Jupyter Notebook, now you can start Deep Learning coding with NVIIDA GPU Accelerations. Congratulations!  
![](/photo/Picture3c.png)   

**Every time start DL Coding (advanced):**  
1. These 2 foder path are connexted:  
   Ubuntu path = /Home/dataset  
   Docker Image path = /notebooks/dataset  
   You can **move training data under Ubuntu path = /Home/dataset**, then you can **access it under Docker Image path = /notebooks/dataset**  
   Look at the example screenshot, any files you put under the left window Ubuntu path = /Home/dataset, you can find it on the right window Docker Image path = /notebooks/dataset  
   This is important skill for you to train external dataset files.

2. Useful Linux instructions  
A. `Check docker images`  
Instruction $「sudo docker images」. You can see all docker images, and repository_name:tag info of all docker images.  
B. `Check containers`  
Instruction $「sudo docker ps 」, to check running containers  
Instruction $「sudo docker ps -a 」, to check all containers (no matter it’s running or not). You can see all containers, all containers’ ID, all containers’ name.  
C. `Delete docker image`  
Instruction $「sudo docker rmi [add docker image’s repository_name:tag]」, to delete it.  
D. `Delete container`  
Instruction $「sudo docker rm [add container’s container id]」, or  
Instruction $「sudo docker rm [add container’s container name]」, to delete it.  
E. `Save/Snapshot a container into a docker image (to keep it forever)`  
Instruction $「sudo docker commit [container_ID] [repository_name:Tag]」  
F. `Save/Snapshot a docker image as a file to be visible by Ubuntu File Folder application, therefore you can move/backup/manage it`  
Instruction $「sudo docker save [repository_name:Tag] -o [external_ubuntu_file_path/file_name]」  
G. `Rename Container`  
Instruction $「sudo docker rename [Original container_name] [Wanted container_name]」  
H. `After reboot, start/attach closed container, find/copy/paste URL to enter Jupyter Notebook`    
Instruction $「sudo docker start -ai [add container’s container id]」, to start/attach container.  
Now you will see an unique URL link. Right click the link to open with Firefox and enter Jupyter Notebook.  
I. `In case of installation failure, you want to reinstall`  
Add “-reinstall” after original install instruction.  
For example: sudo apt install -reinstall cuda  
J. `In case of you failed to download while you do have internet connection, that might caused by DNS setup issue`  
Instruction $「sudo gedit /etc/default/docker」  
Edit document, to remove '#' sign before 'NS 8.8.8.8', then save and close document.  
Reboot PC, or Instruction $「sudo service docker restart」, to reboot PC.  
K. `Sometimes wifi disconnect because of PC enter power saving mode`  
Go to Ubuntu OS, under 'System' icon, find 'Internet' icon.   
Double click 'internet' icon, wifi will be reconnected.  
L. `Inside Jupyter Notebook, how to run instructions # (without quiting Jupyter Notebook and go to terminal`  
You just need to add 1 line of code, which is start with “!” sign.  
For example: 「! pip install」, or「! ls」, or「! cd/home/(your Ubuntu ID)/container」.   
M. `Inside Jupyter Notebook, “Tab” key is useful (part 1)`  
If you run instruction # inside Jupyter Notebook with “!” sign, and don’t know all the optional parameters, here is a useful way by press “Tab” key. (without quit Jupyter Notebook)  
For example, you can add 1 line of code「! Plt.」, and press “Tab” key now, it will show all the optional parameters of plt.  
N. `Inside Jupyter Notebook, “Tab” key is useful (part 2)`  
If you run instruction # inside Jupyter Notebook with “!” sign, and you need to call the dataset directory, here is a useful way by press “Tab” key. (without quit Jupyter Notebook)  
For example, you can add 1 line of text 「p = patient.PatientData(“/home/ and press “Tab” now, it will automatically output all the sub-dictory.
